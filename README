=== Usage ===

The repository is organised as follows:

  * The .nb files are Mathematica notebooks and provide the means to generate 
    the results from the paper, or create new sets of results.
  * The .m files are Mathematica packages, providing function definitions 
    used in the notebooks - you do not need to edit these directly (in fact, 
    you don't have to look at them at all if you don't want to - Mathematica 
    will load them at runtime). For information on individual functions, see help.nb.
  * The data.sqlite file is an SQLite database used to store numerical results 
    generated during the course of writing some papers. To save time 
    reproducing results, some functions may attempt to look them up in the 
    database. This functionality can be controlled using the DatabaseLookup 
    option - see the documentation notebook for more information.
  * Licensing information is contained in COPYING.
